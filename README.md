# CS113 Project
## Programming in Python

###### This is a project for study.com's CS113 class using Python to create a guess the number game

### Project Prompt
>Create a Python project in IDLE and begin the Project Program by developing a Python Function called display title() to display the title and programming specifications for the project.

>Expand the Project Program and create a function called play game() that uses the randint() function that gets the number that the player has to guess. It then returns a random number between 1 and 10. Use a while statement so the user can guess the number until the guess is correct. If the users guess is lower than the random number then display the message 'Too low'. If the user guess is higher than the random number then display the message 'Too high'. If the user guess matches the random number display the message, 'You guessed it '. Then, a return statement returns to the statement in the main() function that is after the call to the play game() function.

>Expand the Project Program and create main() function to the function call statements. Call the display title() function. Then define a variable that will hold the value of yes. Create a loop that will check the variable, while the variable equals yes then call the play game function. Then allow the user to input if they want to play again. If yes, play again, if no end the program.
